					Stuff to remember!

SASA/Self Cert:

	-The first time, you'll need to run the main program to save the config.
	-There can only be one value in the 'TO' field.
	-The single digit values for date should not have a preceeding zero, while it is an absolute must for the month value.
	-The data will be saved ONLY if 'Done' is clicked. Closing the window will NOT save the data.
	-The program will proceed to send the second mail, only after you click 'Ok' in the pop-up dialog, that gets displayed after successfully sending the first mail.
	-The values are stored in the user's home directory [C:/Users/<YOU>/]. Don't delete it, unless necessary!


Onboarding:

	-The excel file has to be modeled after the template provided as example [Titled 'Onboarding.xlsx']. ANY modification with the column numbers [adding/deleting columns] WILL BREAK the program!
	-The excel file should NOT have empty cells, within the range of rows/columns you get the data from!
	-If the last column [Titled 'Status'], is anything beside the word "Sent", the program will send a mail to that particular row.
	-The word file, which was chosen as the template, has to be modified with the placeholder values that can be found when the 'Legend' button is clicked.


VRF:

	-The excel file has to be modeled after the template provided as example [Titled 'VRF.xlsx]. ANY modification with the column numbers [adding/deleting columns] WILL BREAK the program!
	-If the last column [Titled 'Create'] is a 'No', the program WILL NOT create a file for that particular row. Changing to 'Yes' will create a file for that particular row.
	-The excel file should NOT have empty cells, within the range of rows/columns you get the data from!


PM Vaildation:

	-The program has been modeled after the template 'Current PM list' and 'Master PM list'. As long as the inputs conform to the template, you will not have to worry.


PM Budget:

	-Don't use it. Highly not recommended. Amex Clarity site is unstable, and as a result, so is the program.
